# RDUWeatherPredictor.Tests
## Synopsis
This is a XUnit project containing test methods for key points in the `RDUWeatherPredictor` and `RDUWeatherPredictor.Core` projects. These tests do not have complete coverage. Instead, it provides a way for more robust tests to be written. Some tests are not fully implemented.

## How to run tests
1. Open a terminal application
2. Navigate to the top \RDUWeatherPredictor directory
3. run `dotnet test`
